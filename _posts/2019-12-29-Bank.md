Education affects various life decisions both financially & professionally. I studied Portuguese banking institution data in order to find out the relationship between education & housing loan, education & employment varication rate.

#H2 Data: 
Data were drawn from the University of California Irvine(UCI) study of a Portuguese banking institution. Below is the frequency of various data attributes used in the analysis.

Rate of people changing jobs as per their education levels

#H2 Conclusion: 
University degree holders have the highest tendency to take a housing loan vs people who are 4th grader only have the least tendency to take a housing loan.
4th graders have the highest tendency to change jobs but university degree holders tend to stick around the same job for long.
