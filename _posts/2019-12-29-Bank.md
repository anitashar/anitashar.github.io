Are you really thinking of getting a college degree?Will getting higher education help you stick to your job?
Will your current education help in getting a housing loan?These are tough questions .We probably won't be able to find answers for all of them, but let's dive into the data to figure out interesting insights.

Education affects various life decisions both financially & professionally. I studied Portuguese banking institution data in order to find out the relationship between education & housing loan, education & employment varication rate.

## Data: 

[Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) were drawn from the University of California Irvine(UCI) study of a Portuguese banking institution. Below is the frequency of various data attributes used in the analysis.

## Conclusion: 

-University degree holders have the highest tendency to take a housing loan vs people who are 4th grader only have the least tendency to take a housing loan.


-4th graders have the highest tendency to change jobs but university degree holders tend to stick around the same job for long.
